11/8/2018 9:41:55,S1,L1_NCG_A,5,5,None,No,Memory based on attention
11/8/2018 11:36:46,S2,L2_NCG_A,5,5,,,"Assessment of communication/description skills in regard to language experience. Also, relationship between description and memory of that picture later on. "
11/9/2018 13:30:24,S3,L3_NCG_A,5,5,One pattern I saw was that my partner seemed to be a little too quick in answering the questions. Something seemed a little odd ,There were a few specific pictures that I didn't know the specific name for,I believe this experiment was trying the determine which objects that I see first in terms of my descriptions and how those observations impact my memory. 
11/9/2018 14:32:54,S4,L1_CG_A,5,5,"the movement patterns would start to repeat (a diagonal movement, a loop, someone returning to their original starting point)","i wasn't sure if the way i was describing the scenes was entirely appropriate? at the beginning i described people with ""moved in a straight/diagonal/etc"" direction, but when i remembered the initial instructions i tried to be more attentive to how they were moving (tiptoeing, skating, etc)",seeing what words people use to describe movements/actions and how people interpret these words in their head/memory?
11/9/2018 15:19:03,S5,L2_CG_A,5,5,none,no,"What details in the video are you paying attention too, describing, and remembering."
11/9/2018 16:41:32,S6,L3_CG_A,4,4,Each video would feature an object moving from one place to another.,No,To see if the speaker's description of a video helps the listener answer the question correctly about a video. To assess one's memory of videos that he/she just saw. 
11/12/2018 9:35:12,S7,L1_NCG_A,5,5,A moving subject (animal or person) was always moving from one object to another.,"It was pretty straightforward, but there may have been better verbs to describe the subjects' motion that I did not use.","I think the experiment was about how well you can describe a scene or a motion. The experiment probably also tests preconceptions/assumptions about the context of certain scenes, as well as short-term memory of each scene."
11/12/2018 12:29:51,S8,L2_NCG_A,5,4,none,remembering little details the second time around,"I wasn't sure at first, but now I understand that this experiment is looking at the relationship between verbally saying things and memory. The more you describe something, the better you remember it"
11/12/2018 13:23:21,S9,L3_NCG_A,5,5,The focus of interest may have been what objects the animls/people were moving to and from.,,"I think it may have been about how we construct sentences relating to movement, and how this correlates with things like memory and logic tasks."
11/12/2018 14:29:08,S10,L1_CG_A,5,5,I noticed that in almost every scene there was something that moved from one object to another.,The only part of the experiment taht was difficult for me at times was thinking of how specifically I wanted to describe the clip.,I think that the experiment was about how people describe and interpret the descriptions of different situations.
11/12/2018 15:30:43,S11,L2_CG_A,5,5,none,it was hard to remember some specific words when describing items in clips,attention to detail when speaking and recalling 
11/12/2018 17:08:09,S12,L3_CG_A,4,4,We communicated similarly for each trail,Not particularly,How visual representations are interpreted based on the various elements of image and motion. 
11/13/2018 9:20:49,S13,L1_NCG_A,4,5,similar video styles,no,I'm not sure!
11/13/2018 10:20:13,S14,L2_NCG_A,5,5,Very slight differences in the videos during the second round,No,Probably seeing if telling someone else what the video was would help me remember the details later
11/13/2018 11:20:47,S15,L3_NCG_A,5,5,,,If having to describe something assists in memory 
11/14/2018 10:33:56,S16,L1_CG_A,5,5,Most of the videos involved something moving in some way from some object to another object.,Sometimes it was difficult to come up with the exact right word to describe how the object was moving while still being succint.,"Something about how humans describe and interpret motion and words for motion, and/or how speech describing an event affects memory retention of the event. "
11/15/2018 10:27:56,S17,L2_CG_A,5,5,"The subject often moved from one place to another, and I realized it would be helpful to mention the objects that they approach.",No,Maybe how different kinds of encoding (based on how I described the scene) and how it affected my memory of the scene.
11/15/2018 11:33:05,S18,L3_CG_A,5,5,a lot of circles involved,The tower of Hanoi was harder than expected,I think the experiment was about communication and learning and whether explaining a concept or listening to someone explain a concept and having to visualize it on your own makes for better remembering and understanding of the subject.
11/16/2018 13:36:44,S19,L1_NCG_A,5,5,My partner was able to identify his response very quickly at times ,No,The effects of explaining visual scenarios on memory
11/16/2018 14:21:18,S20,L2_NCG_A,5,5,Not any,I think the Tower of Hanoi was somewhat challenging.,"I am not exactly certain, but I believe language's correlation to memory. "
11/16/2018 15:28:25,S21,L2_NCG_A,4,5,didn't notice any patterns,some objects were very specific and i didn't know how to describe them,i don't know
11/16/2018 16:35:33,S22,L3_NCG_A,5,5,Most of the videos had movement from one clear starting point to one end point with unique objects that mark the start and end. ,It was difficult deciding how much detail was needed in describing the scene sufficiently.,I don't really know. Maybe it was either about how describing something to someone impacts memory compared to not describing something.
11/19/2018 12:27:05,S23,L1_CG_A,5,5,Videos were very simple and could easily be altered in a way such that the listener would have trouble distinguishing between two different but similar videos. ,No part. ,I think the experiment was about how listening to a description of an event can seem so straight forward yet lead to difficulties once presented with a similar yet different video/event. 
11/19/2018 13:26:14,S24,L2_CG_A,4,4,Movement of objects from one side to another for the first part. Different colors/ images but of the same objects in the second part,It was difficult to remember the specific object/ color that I saw before (i.e. if the tent that I saw again was the same as the tent before),Communication between people that is tested in the second part of the experiment
11/19/2018 14:26:27,S24,L3_CG_A,5,5,na,na,language and memory
11/19/2018 15:23:07,S26,L1_NCG_A,5,5,"The animations seemed to be the same length, and generally pretty vague activities of everyday life.","No part of the experiment was difficult for me, but I did find it slightly harder to recall exact details about each clip to determine which ones were different. Additionally, I sometimes didn't know the name of what was being depicted in the video, and had to describe it to my partner.","Something to do with (1) visual images made by describing a scene to a partner, and (2) memory of those visual images and how they compared to different clips."
11/19/2018 16:27:25,S27,L2_NCG_A,4,5,My partner would verbally acknowledge when she was ready to move to the next clip.,,I think it might have been about the effects of communicating information on memory.
11/20/2018 10:45:49,S28,L3_NCG_A,5,5,"Lots of animate objects and several fantasy situations. My partner always said ""ok"" in response to my description. Most videos involved some simple translation.",I wasn't confident the barn was the same in the memory section of the horse video.,Relationships between motivated description/perception (appropriate for children's movies) and recall of specific concepts that are relevant to that bias.
11/20/2018 11:40:59,S29,L1_CG_A,4,4,Memory accuracy was correlated with specificity of description,The Towers of Hanoi task was difficult because I was not able to learn the strategy in the two trials.,Whether learning and memory are affected by specificity of communication.
11/27/2018 9:45:07,S30,L2_CG_A,5,5,The video clips involved a subject performing a simple action.,,Understanding how people produce and interpret language
11/27/2018 10:35:27,S30,L3_CG_A,5,5,The movemnts of the objects in the video were very simple and somewhat easy to describe,The only difficult aspect of the experiment was describing certain objects that I was not familiar with such as the compass/rooster thing on top of a house as well as a spinny wheel thing in a farm video.,Understanding how people use language to describe things to others who are not witnessing certain actions - understanding what words and types of descriptions speakers choose
11/27/2018 11:28:33,S32,L1_NCG_P,2,4,became easier to describe scene as time passed on,,visual perception
11/29/2018 9:32:51,S33,L2_NCG_P,4,5,The expreimenter warned us when we were about to make a mistake in a the warm up game. The videos that were shown in the memory task either had a movement change or small change in the items in the background. ,Explaining some of the videos with exact precision and in a clear manner. It was difficult to follow instructions in the warm up game. ,Understand how language is translated visually to orally. 
11/29/2018 10:39:12,S34,L3_NCG_P,5,5,A lot of the videos involved one person/animal moving from one side/corner of the screen to another.,"Not really, a couple items I was unsure of the terms for, but that was all I can think of.",How descriptions of things and word choice influence the way you perceive things in your head? Not sure. 
11/29/2018 11:18:18,S35,L1_NCG_A,5,5,Attention to detail is important,Determining what level of description I should use as the speaker,"How well someone can describe a video clip to their partner, and whether or not the description allows the listener to choose the clips they viewed."
11/30/2018 13:26:09,S36,L2_NCG_A,5,5,,,The experiment was about the ability to understand something from a description as well as retention.
11/30/2018 14:18:50,S37,L3_NCG_A,4,5,THe videos mainly involved a an object or being going from one place or thing to another,In the beginning finding the right words to describe the videos was slightly tricky,Our perceptions as listeners and providers of dialogue. How they effect our memory 
11/30/2018 15:51:37,S38,L1_CG_A,5,5,The movement patterns of the people/objects/animals was similar in the clips,,"I believe the experiment was testing our selective attention, trying to assess what we pay attention to in certain situations when told what to look for and how that affects what we really remember about what we see"
11/30/2018 16:29:37,S39,L2_CG_A,3,3,I noticed that the the video was very simple to explain and didn't really have complex actions.,"The description part was easy, but in the recalling part, there were times where I wasn't sure if a part of the video was the exact same to the one I described.",I think the experiment was about if the person that described the video and saw it did better on the memory tests compared to the person who listened to the descriptions but didn't see the video. 
12/3/2018 9:36:43,S40,L3_CG_A,4,5,the main object would move across the scene ,no ,how people use words to explain things to people 
12/3/2018 13:28:01,S41,L2_CG_A,4,5,it was always one object moving to the another place,no,how likely we are to remember something if we've explicitly mentioned/described it
12/3/2018 14:41:23,S42,L1_NCG_P,5,5,The animations in the memory task only changed small details about the subjects in the animations from the first task. The memory task would probably be much more difficult for my partner.,"I wasn't sure how much detail to give my partner in the first task, since I did not know what kinds of questions she would be asked to answer.",I think the two tasks together were meant to test how well someone who had only had something described to them would remember an event compared to someone who had actually seen the event.
12/6/2018 11:20:25,S43,L2_NCG_A,5,5,he would tell me when he was finished answering the questions.,the last part was hard to recognize small details,"Based on how I described the video to my partner, was there any language that helped me in recalling if I had seen it or not"
12/7/2018 16:21:10,S44,L1_NCG_A,5,5,,,no idea
12/9/2018 11:33:17,S45,L1_NCG_A,5,5,there was a pattern when we were making the towers. It seemed that when solving the larger towers we would first construct the smaller towers then move them on top of the newly added pieces.,I think if we had to do any larger towers it would have gotten difficult.,How memory is related to explaining information.
12/9/2018 12:27:32,S46,L3_NCG_A,5,5,simple animations / videos,,"whether i would include detailed descriptions, like color, or rather describe the overall theme."
12/10/2018 10:38:19,S47,L2_CG_A,4,5,,explaining motion was difficult for me,one's ability to work with a partner.
12/10/2018 12:24:28,S48,L3_CG_A,3,5,"movement from one location to the next (walking, running, jumping","the memory part - very small details were altered (color of trees, type of boat etc)",ability to reproduce (memory)
12/10/2018 14:28:10,S49,L1_NCG_A,5,5,I noticed that in the second part many of the videos changed slightly.,It was difficult remembering if certain parts of the video changed or if I imagined that. Was testing my memory.,I think the experiment was about memory and explaining videos.
12/10/2018 15:25:31,S50,L2_NCG_A,5,5,There were a number of small changes in the two trials in the colors and shapes of objects,Remembering specifics of the backgrounds of each image,Testing if describing/seeing images versus hearing descriptions of an image makes it easier to remember particular images
12/10/2018 16:39:07,S51,L3_NCG_A,5,5,"Simple tasks, but usually random",The memory task,comprehension and judgement
12/11/2018 9:24:37,S52,L1_CG_A,5,4,"As it progressed, my partner spent less and less time looking at each screen.",No.,The information that we think is necessary to include in descriptions; how specific we are with our language.
12/11/2018 11:26:22,S53,L2_CG_A,5,5,The images moved in the same ways.,No,How adults comprehend language and how long the memory is retained. 
12/12/2018 10:30:58,S55,L1_CG_A,4,4,"tower part - there was a pattern to solving the towers that my partner and i got into; watching the films - we got into a pattern of moving the screens, me describing the scene and her saying ""yep"" after clicking the answers twice",the tower part was difficult for me because sometimes it was hard to see into the future... i also found it difficult to decide how much information to give about each scene,memory when seeing something versus hearing about something
12/12/2018 10:49:54,S54,L3_CG_A,4,4,None,No,How the participant described the videos
12/12/2018 14:54:28,S56,L2_NCG_A,4,5,"She seemed to find some of my descriptions or metaphors amusing. The motions in the videos were similiar regardless of the character, creature, or item that was moving.",It was difficult to know how I should describe the videos: be exhaustive and convey each factual detail? Or be attentive to the vibe and try to communicate the impressions I got of the videos?,Maybe it is looking at how the way a person might describe something impacts another person's perception of it before they engage with the material themselves.
12/12/2018 15:29:57,S57,L3_NCG_A,4,5,All the clips consisted of a singular moving object with two nonmoving objects.,Deciding which objects within the clip should be mentioned caused some difficulty at times. ,I think the experiment aimed to determine how well two strangers communicate and how much communication is used.
12/12/2018 16:25:28,S58,L1_CG_A,5,5,a lot of twirling in the original videos. Then a lot of color changes for the second set of videos,Trying to glean what info was important and what was not in describing it to my partner,"How talking about, hearing, and seeing visuals aid in memory"
12/12/2018 17:32:08,S59,L2_CG_A,5,5,There was always something moving from part of the scrren to another. Sometimes animals or humans or creatures,No,Communication or what person remembers after watching a video or a clip
12/14/2018 14:31:54,S60,L3_CG_A,4,4,They were very short clips of a person or animal walking or moving,Not really,Understanding teamwork/collaboration and how people communicate
